# Automatic-Diacritization-Project-
Diacritization of Arabic text is defined as the task of automatically predicting the letter diacritics given a sentence. Arabic is a language composed of letters and other marks representing phonetic information, known as Diacritics, which are small marks that should be placed above or below most of the letters. Our two common approaches to address the Arabic Text Diacritization problem: Machine Learning (ML) approaches and Deep Learning (DL) approaches. We aim to show that DL approaches are superior to classical models. To do so, we tested several models such as: SVM, naive bayes (Unstructured Models), HMM, MEMM from the NLP domain (Structured Models) and two neural network models. Both structured and unstructured models will be referred to and incorporated while focusing mainly on the neural networks in both the advanced and the creative parts. The results of the experiments show that the performance improved with the increase in model complexity. Furthermore, the deep learning models significantly outperform classical ML and NLP
￼approaches. (0.95 accuracy for the CRF model compared to 0.645 and 0.735 for the naïve bayes and MEMM model respectively)
